# Appendix: Fitness for purpose: Automatic bug filing

## Introduction

This Appendix describes how to produce SARIF log files that are <a href="Glossary.md#fit-for-purpose">_fit for purpose_</a> for automatic bug filing. It is an example of the "playbook" for producing fit-for-purpose SARIF log files, described in the Appendix [Fitness for purpose: Overview](Fitness-for-purpose-overview.md).

The standard described here works well for a particular bug filing system used internally at Microsoft.
You might be able to use it without change, or you might have to adapt it to your company's engineering system.
In that case, do read the [Overview](Fitness-for-purpose-overview.md) to understand the purpose of each component of the playbook given here.
